# Password Generator Starter Code
###### By Aaron Cendejas
-----------------------------------
## Description
* GIVEN I need a new, secure password
* WHEN I click the button to generate a password
* THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* WHEN prompted for password criteria
* THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password
* THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
* THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt
* THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered
* THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated
* THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
* inserted a lot of comments for assistance on future projects/assignments

## Screenshot

## Issues
1. I wish that the prompt didn't just disappear when one of the criteria was not met.
2. My TA mentioned that I would have to call a function within a function and I didn't feel 
ready to do that.
3. Figuring out an alert to force the user to select at least one character type was very difficult. I need to review the || and && commands to develop a better understanding on how to use them. 
4. I had to search the functionality of a lot of commands which scares me. I am concerned that I do not understand the material as well as I should, since I have to google so many commands and their functionality. 
5. I like that the password is generated randomly. However, I wish the password could be generated randomly but containing at least one of each of the characters indicated by the user. My program doesn't necessarily include all of the character types the user asks for.
